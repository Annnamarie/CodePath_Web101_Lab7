# Simple Form Validation Lab

## Overview
This lab focuses on implementing form validation to ensure that no input fields are left empty when a user submits a form.

## Learning Objectives
- Utilize conditionals and for loops to validate form input
- Implement form validation to check for empty form fields

## Steps Implemented
1. Fetched the form elements using the `getElementById` method.
2. Created a for loop to iterate over each input element in the form.
3. Used conditionals to check if any input element is empty.
4. Displayed an alert message using the `alert()` function if any input field is empty.
5. Added an event listener to the form to validate it on submission.

## Stretch Feature Implemented
- Used the `alert()` function to warn the user if a form submission is incorrect, specifying which input field is missing data.
